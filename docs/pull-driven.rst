Pull Driven Requests
====================

Typically MVC frameworks are "push" based. In otherwords use mechanisms to "push" data to 
a view and not vice-versa. A "pull" framework instead request ("pull") data from a view.

Pull strategy is useful for example during a `for` statement (not only for that [obviously]...). Look 
for an example:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php foreach ($this->users as $user) : ?>
    <?php
        // Pull data from a controller. 
        $userDetail = $this->pull("/detail/user/id/{$user->id}");
    ?>
    <div class="element">
        <div class="name"><?php echo $userDetail->name;?> <?php echo $userDetail->surname; ?></div>
        <!-- other -->
    </div>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
 
`simple-mvc` implementation
---------------------------

`simple-mvc` has ***push*** and ***pull*** mechanisms. The *push* is quite simple and a typical 
operation. See an example

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php
    class EgController extends Controller
    {
        public function actAction()
        {
            // PUSH to view a variable named <code>var</code>
            $this->view->var = "hello";
        }
    }

The view show the pushed variable

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php echo $this->var; ?>

The `pull` strategy is quite similar but use the return statement of a controller to retrive 
all the information. Consider in advance that `simple-mvc` doesn't require a valid controller
for retrive a view, that view is mapped directly. See an example

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <!-- this view is test/miss.phtml (/test/miss GET) -->
    <div>
        <h1>Missing controller and action</h1>
    
        <?php $data = $this->pull("/ctr/act"); ?>
    
        <!-- example -->
        <?php echo $data->title; ?>
    </div>

The view require a `pull` operation from a controller named `ctr` and action `act`. See it:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php
    class CtrController extends Controller
    {
        public function actAction()
        {
            $data = new stdClass();
        
            $data->title = "The title";
        
            // The return type doesn't care...
            return $data;
        }
    }

You can use a "pull" controller as a normal controller with the attached view, but remember
that when you request for a "pull" operation the view is never considered and the framework
remove it without consider the output, only the `return` statement will be used.
